				<p>David G. Flatt, Ltd creates handmade furnishings for retail, 
					residential, marketing events and exhibit design from its 
					shop in Long Island City, New York. Over the course of the 
					last 30 years, the company has evolved from a one-man operation 
					into the collaborative effort of a creative team.
				</p>	
	
				<p>	Shortly after receiving his Bachelor of Fine Arts in the early 70’s, 
					David Flatt began David G. Flatt, Ltd in Madison, Wisconsin, with one 
					of a kind furnishings created and sold at juried art fairs throughout
					the United States. In 1985, David G. Flatt, Ltd established its 
					New York home base after he completed a Masters in Fine Arts focused 
					in Industrial Design from Pratt Institute. By 1997, David G. Flatt, Ltd 
					had expanded to include the execution of retail venue design for clients 
					such as Bloomingdales, Elie Tahari and Theory.
				</p>
				<p>	The company brought the same energy and vision to retail venues that had 
					made it such a success in furniture design and production. As a result of 
					client demand and consistent successful collaboration, David G. Flatt, Ltd 
					expanded into fashion tradeshow exhibits where the company quickly gained 
					a reputation for being able to work under the rigors of tradeshow conditions 
					and still produce unique, boutique-like settings stylized to showcase each 
					individual client’s brand, with booths tailored to enhance the client’s 
					product.
