			<div class="about">
				<p><strong>David G. Flatt, Ltd</strong> 
					creates handmade furnishings for retail, residential, marketing events and exhibit 
					design from its shop in Long Island City, New York. Over the course of the last 30 years, the company 
					has evolved from a one-man operation into the collaborative effort of a creative team.
				</p>	
	
				<p>	Shortly after receiving his Bachelor of Fine Arts in the early 70’s, David Flatt began David G. Flatt, Ltd 
					in Madison, Wisconsin, with one of a kind furnishings created and sold at juried art fairs throughout the 
					United States. In 1985, David G. Flatt, Ltd established its New York home base after he completed a 
					Masters in Fine Arts focused in Industrial Design from Pratt Institute. By 1997, David G. Flatt, Ltd had 
					expanded to include the execution of retail venue design for clients such as Bloomingdales, Elie Tahari 
					and Theory.
				</p>
				<p>	The company brought the same energy and vision to retail venues that had made it such a success in 
					furniture design and production. As a result of client demand and consistent successful collaboration, 
					David G. Flatt, Ltd expanded into fashion tradeshow exhibits where the company quickly gained a 
					reputation for being able to work under the rigors of tradeshow conditions and still produce unique, 
					boutique-like settings stylized to showcase each individual client’s brand, with booths tailored to 
					enhance the client’s product.
